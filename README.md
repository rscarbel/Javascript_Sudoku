# Javascript_Sudoku (Old)
One of my first projects in Javascript
What makes this project impressive is not the quality of the code, but rather the point in my coding journey in which I created it.
I made this after slightly more than two weeks of learning Javascript/HTML/CSS. I used online resources and assidiously worked from square zero to produce this.
Sure, it may be riddled with sub-optimal practices and inefficiencies, but it is better than what I would have anticipated myself to produce after two weeks.
This project is more to show how quickly I learn new things. I may not be the best coder as it is, but I'm definitely eager and able to move in that direction.
